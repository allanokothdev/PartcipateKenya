# 🧠 Problem Statement – Civic Participation Gaps in Kenya

## 1. Government’s Challenge  
Governments in Kenya—both national and county—are constitutionally mandated to involve citizens in decision-making (e.g., Articles 10 and 174(c)). However, real-world engagement faces structural challenges:

- **High Cost**: Traditional methods like barazas and town halls are expensive, especially in remote regions.
- **Low Turnout**: Forums often attract poor attendance due to timing conflicts, travel costs, or lack of awareness.
- **Unstructured Feedback**: Paper and verbal submissions are hard to digitize, quantify, or follow up on.

The result? Policies are often designed and implemented without meaningful input, which leads to resistance, poor service delivery, and low trust.

## 2. Citizen Challenges  
Citizens, particularly youth and marginalized groups, are largely excluded due to:

- **Limited Access to Information**: Budgets, plans, and projects are rarely communicated accessibly or in real time.
- **No Feedback Loops**: Citizens are left wondering if their voice mattered, fostering apathy and distrust.
- **Digital Exclusion**: Many platforms are data-heavy, urban-centric, or overly complex for broad engagement.

## 3. Democratic Consequences  
These challenges undermine democracy and equitable development:

- **Weak Trust in Institutions**
- **Inequitable Resource Distribution** due to limited feedback from underserved areas
- **Suppressed Civic Voice**, especially among youth, rural communities, and women
- **Reduced Transparency and Accountability**, enabling misuse of funds or stalled projects
