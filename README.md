🧠 Problem Statement – Civic Participation Gaps in Kenya
1. Government’s Challenge
Governments at both national and county levels are constitutionally required to engage citizens in policy-making and resource allocation decisions. However:

Cost: Traditional public participation forums (barazas, town halls, etc.) are expensive and logistically intensive, especially across vast or remote regions.

Low Turnout: Physical meetings often attract low and unrepresentative attendance due to poor timing, travel costs, or lack of awareness.

Fragmented Feedback: Paper-based or verbal inputs are difficult to organize, quantify, or act upon efficiently.

As a result, many decisions are made without meaningful citizen input, leading to flawed implementation, community resistance, or poor service delivery.

2. Citizen Challenges
On the other hand, citizens—particularly youth and marginalized groups—face barriers such as:

Limited access to reliable, timely information on projects, budgets, and policies.

Lack of accountability mechanisms to track how their input was used or whether promises were fulfilled.

Frustration and apathy due to a history of exclusion or tokenism in participation processes.

3. Democratic Consequences
These gaps weaken democratic governance by:

Undermining trust between citizens and institutions

Reducing equity in the distribution of public goods and services

Fueling regional tensions when some communities feel unheard or underserved

Suppressing youth voices, missing out on a large and vibrant demographic in decision-making
